#Groups of individual statements, which make a single code block are called suites in Python. Compound
# or complex statements, such as if, while, def, and class require a header line and a suite.

#Header lines begin the statement (with the keyword) and terminate with a colon ( : ) and are followed by one
# or more lines which make up the suite. For example âˆ’

if expression :
   suite
elif expression :
   suite
else :
   suite
