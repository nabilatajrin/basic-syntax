#Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Python.

#Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers âˆ’

#    Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

#    Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.

#    Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strong private identifier.

#    If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.
